}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \dQuote{poisson_nmf_fit} or
\dQuote{multinom_topic_model_fit}.}

\item{color}{The data mapped to the color \dQuote{aesthetic} in the
plot. When \code{color = "loading"}, the estimated loadings (stored
the \code{L} matrix) in the Poisson NMF model are plotted; when
\code{color = "mixprop"}, the estimated mixture proportions (which are
recovered from the loadings by calling
\code{\link{poisson2multinom}} are shown. When \code{fit} is a
\dQuote{multinom_topic_model_fit} object, the only available option
is \code{color = "mixprop"}. In most settings, the mixture proportions
are preferred, even if the 2-d embedding is computed from the
loading matrix of the Poisson NMF model.}

\item{k}{The topic, or topics, selected by number or name. One plot
is created per selected topic. When not specified, all topics are
plotted.}

\item{tsne}{A 2-d embedding of the samples (rows of X), or a subset
of the samples, such as an output from
\code{\link{tsne_from_topics}}. It should be a list object with the
same structure as a \code{tsne_from_topics} output; see
\code{\link{tsne_from_topics}} for details. If not provided, a 2-d
t-SNE embedding will be estimated automatically by calling
\code{tsne_from_topics}.}

\item{ggplot_call}{The function used to create the plot. Replace
\code{tsne_plot_ggplot_call} with your own function to
customize the appearance of the plot.}

\item{plot_grid_call}{When multiple topics are selected, this is
the function used to arrange the plots into a grid using
\code{\link[cowplot]{plot_grid}}. It should be a function accepting
a single argument, \code{plots}, a list of \code{ggplot} objects.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to
\code{tsne_from_topics}. These arguments are only used if
\code{tsne} is not provided.}

\item{dat}{A data frame passed as input to
\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}, containing, at a minimum, columns
\dQuote{d1}, \dQuote{d2} (the first and second dimensions in the
2-d embedding), and \dQuote{loading}.}

\item{topic.label}{The name or number of the topic being plotted;
it is only used to determine the plot title.}

\item{font.size}{Font size used in plot.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Visualize the "structure" of the Poisson NMF loadings
  or multinomial topic model mixture proportions by projection onto a
  2-d surface. Samples in the projection are colored according to the
  their loadings/proportions. By default, t-SNE is used to compute
  the 2-d embedding from the loadings or mixture proportions.
}
\details{
This is a lightweight interface primarily intended to
expedite creation of scatterplots for visualizing the loadings or
mixture proportions in 2-d; most of the \dQuote{heavy lifting} is
done by ggplot2. The 2-d embedding itself is computed by invoking
function \code{\link{tsne_from_topics}} (unless the \dQuote{tsne}
input is provided). For more control over the plot's appearance,
the plot can be customized by modifying the \code{ggplot_call} and
\code{plot_grid_call} arguments.

An effective 2-d visualization may also necessitate some
fine-tunning of the t-SNE settings, such as the
\dQuote{perplexity}, or the number of samples included in the
plot. The t-SNE settings can be controlled by the additional
arguments (\dots) passed to \code{tsne_from_topics}; see
\code{\link{tsne_from_topics}} for details. Alternatively, a 2-d
embedding may be pre-computed, and passed as argument \code{tsne}
to \code{tsne_plot}.
